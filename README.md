This is a FREE game prototype.  
  
[RELEASE DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/Dark-Gran/TZOR/releases/tag/1.0)  
  
Does not include JRE and therefore requires Java 8 to run. ([download java](https://www.java.com/en/download/))  
  
  
## About Project  
  
([see original website](https://github.com/Dark-Gran/TZOR-Website))
  
#### Original Project Goals  
- Learn to use Java in combination with LibGDX/Box2D engine (+gradle).
- Test certain art style.
- Test gameplay with certain parameters:
  - Player must be represented however the game must be playable with one finger.
  - Player's representation must be, at least in this prototype, peaceful (eg. no weapons), but it may have "abilities" (eg. magnetic when turned on).
  - Game's "obstacles" must, at least in this prototype, only arise from:
    - physics 
    - level layout (ie. maze containing puzzles)

#### Gameplay Conclusions  
  
Despite the simplified controls, the physics themselves make this game more "difficult on the platformer/arcade side" (more than expected), meanwhile the "puzzle side" most probably suffers for it.  
The feedback gave birth to three alternative drafts, each of which focuses on one of these aspects (arcade vs puzzle), however these only exist on paper for now.
