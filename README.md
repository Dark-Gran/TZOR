## About Project  
  
_Project goals:_
- Learn to use Java in combination with LibGDX/Box2D engine.
- Test certain art style.
- Test gameplay with certain parameters:
  - Player must be represented however the game must be playable with one finger.
  - Player's representation must be, at least in this prototype, peaceful (eg. no weapons), but it may have "abilities" (eg. magnetic when turned on).
  - Game's "obstacles" must, at least in this prototype, only arise from:
    - physics 
    - level layout (ie. maze containing puzzles)
